description: Learn how to configure the Cost Control Dashboard and it's supporting infrastructure.
---

By default, the platform comes with the cost control dashboard enabled, which offers insights into potential cost
savings by leveraging virtual clusters.

In order to track allocations and calculate savings for workloads running inside
virtual clusters the platform deploys and manages [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and
[OpenCost](https://www.opencost.io/) on each connected cluster. Prometheus is backed by a time series database that
requires persistent volume storage in order to retain metrics over time. The platform managed Prometheus is configured to
collect the minimum metrics required for the cost control dashboard. OpenCost provides CPU and Memory allocation metrics
for the deployed workloads.

In addition to the connected cluster Prometheus, the cluster hosting the platform will have a global Prometheus
installed that is configured to aggregate metrics from all connected clusters. This utilizes the connected cluster private
network so no additional networking configuration is required.

:::warning Storage Requirements
By default, the Cost Control Dashboard will request 60Gi persistent volumes for each connected cluster's metrics, and an
additional 60Gi persistent volume for global metric aggregation. See the [Configuration](#configuration) section for
details on enabling / disabling the dashboard or configuring its resource needs.
:::

## Configuration
Even though the platform manages Prometheus and OpenCost automatically, there are settings that can be configured to
better suite your specific environments or needs. The primary configuration is part of the [platform config](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/platform/configure/config)
under `costControl`.

Since the cost control dashboard is enabled by default, it must be explicitly disabled by setting `costControl.enabled` to `false`:
```yaml title="Disabling the Cost Control Dashboard"
config:
  costControl:
    enabled: false
```

The remaining configuration is to customize the cost settings, the global Prometheus, and the connected cluster OpenCost
and Prometheus. These are detailed in the next few sections.

### Cost Settings
The platform provides initial cost defaults as shown below. These can be customized for your environment.
```yaml title="Default Cost Settings"
config:
  costControl:
    settings:
      # Average CPU cost
      averageCPUPricePerNode:
        price: 31
        timePeriod: Monthly
      # Average Memory cost
      averageRAMPricePerNode:
        price: 31
        timePeriod: Monthly
      # Monthly or Yearly cost for Hosted Control Planes
      controlPlanePricePerCluster:
        price: 900
        timePeriod: Yearly
```

### Global Prometheus Configuration
These settings control the global Prometheus's availability, retention, storage, cpu and memory configuration. The
default settings are provided below for reference, and may be customized.
```yaml title="Default Global Prometheus Settings"
config:
  costControl:
    global:
      metrics:
        # Number of replicas for the Prometheus Deployment
        replicas: 1
        # Prometheus TSDB retention settings: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/#operational-aspects
        retention: 1y
        # CPU and Memory Requests and Limits for the Prometheus Deployment
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 6Gi
          limits:
            cpu: '2'
            memory: 6Gi
        # Storage Settings for Persistent Volumes
        storage:
          size: 60Gi
          # Valid values:
          # - null:  use the default storage class
          # - "": disable automatic storage provisioning
          # - name of the preferred configured storage class
          storageClass: null
```

`retention` refers to Prometheus's TSDB retention settings. Details regarding valid units can be found in the
[prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/#operational-aspects)

`storageClass` configures the storage class that should be used for provisioning of the Prometheus deployment's
`StatefulSet`. Valid values are:
- `null`: use the cluster's default storage class
- `""` (empty string): disable automatic provisioning
- The name of a preconfigured storage class on the cluster

:::warning Overriding Resources
Overridden `resources` are not merged with the defaults to avoid unexpected changes from Helm charts used by the
platform to manage Prometheus. Therefore, all requests and limits that you wish to apply should be provided.
:::

### Cluster Prometheus Configuration
These settings control the Prometheus's configuration for each connected cluster. These will be applied uniformly
across multiple clusters, but can be customized using [Cluster Specific Configuration](#cluster-specific-configuration).
```yaml title="Default Cluster Prometheus Settings"
config:
  costControl:
    cluster:
      metrics:
        # Number of replicas for the Prometheus Deployment
        replicas: 1
        # Prometheus TSDB retention settings: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/#operational-aspects
        retention: 1y
        # CPU and Memory Requests and Limits for the Prometheus Deployment
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 3Gi
          limits:
            cpu: '1'
            memory: 3Gi
        # Storage Settings for Persistent Volumes
        storage:
          size: 60Gi
          # Valid values:
          # - null:  use the default storage class
          # - "": disable automatic storage provisioning
          # - name of the preferred configured storage class
          storageClass: null
```

:::warning Overriding Resources
Overridden `resources` are not merged with the defaults to avoid unexpected changes from Helm charts used by the
platform to manage Prometheus. Therefore, all requests and limits that you wish to apply should be provided.
:::

### Cluster OpenCost Configuration
These settings control the OpenCost deployment on each connected cluster. While there are many possible ways to
configure OpenCost, the Platform configures it with the minimum settings required for the dashboard. As such only
availability, CPU, and memory settings may be configured.

```yaml title="Default OpenCost Settings"
config:
  costControl:
    cluster:
      opencost:
        # Number of replicas for the OpenCost Deployment
        replicas: 1
        # CPU and Memory Requests and Limits for the OpenCost Deployment
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 3Gi
          limits:
            cpu: '1'
            memory: 3Gi
```

:::warning Overriding Resources

### Cluster Specific Configuration
For individual cluster configuration, the [Cluster](/platform/api/resources/clusters) resource allows for further
configuration specific to each cluster.
