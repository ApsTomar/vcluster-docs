This section consists of security recommendations for the direct configuration of Kubernetes control plane processes.

_Assessment focus for vCluster_: Key areas include making sure that correct permissions are provided to sensitive files such as certificate and key files.


# 1.1 Control Plane Node Configuration Files
## 1.1.20 Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI certificate file permissions are set to 600 or more restrictive (Manual)

**Result:** Warn

**Remediation**: Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the control plane node. For example,
```bash
find /data/pki -type f -name '*.crt' -exec chmod 600 {} +
```

**Audit:** Verify that all certificate file permissions are set to 600 recursively i.e. any .crt files inside another
directory residing at `/data/pki` should also have the same permissions.
```bash
find /data/pki/ -name '*.crt' | xargs stat -c "%n permissions=%a"
```


## 1.1.21 Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI key file permissions are set to 600 (Manual)

**Result:** Warn

**Remediation**: Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the control plane node. For example,
```bash
find /data/pki -type f -name '*.key' -exec chmod 600 {} +
```

**Audit:** Verify that all certificate file permissions are set to 600 recursively i.e. any .key files inside another
directory residing at `/data/pki` should also have the same permissions.
```bash
find /data/pki/ -name '*.key' | xargs stat -c "%n permissions=%a"
```
