vCluster outputs structured logs that help you monitor and troubleshoot your virtual clusters. You can configure the log format to suit your monitoring and analysis tools and workflows.

## Configure log encoding

You can set the log encoding format in your `vcluster.yaml` configuration:

<InterpolatedCodeBlock 
  code={`logging:
  encoding: [[VAR:ENCODING:json]]`} 
  language="yaml" 
/>

Select either `json` or `console` for the `encoding` value.

:::note Platform logging
The `logging.encoding` setting only affects vCluster component logs. Platform-generated logs use a separate configuration.

## Log encoding formats

vCluster supports two log encoding formats:

- [console](#console-format) (_Default_): Human-readable format ideal for development and manual log review.
- [JSON](#json-format): Structured format for log aggregation and automated analysis.

### Console format

The console format provides human-readable logs with timestamps, log levels, source locations, and contextual information:

```text
2025-06-16 04:43:25	INFO	license	loader/inject.go:52	initializing license...	{"component": "vcluster"}
2025-06-16 04:43:25	INFO	license	loader/inject.go:59	detected license type	{"component": "vcluster", "licenseType": "Online"}
2025-06-16 04:43:29	INFO	online/license.go:141	Enabled features:	{"component": "vcluster"}
2025-06-16 04:43:29	INFO	online/license.go:146	rancher-integration	{"component": "vcluster"}
```

The console format is best suited for local development and testing, where developers benefit from quick, readable output. It also works well for manual log review and debugging, especially when troubleshooting issues directly in the terminal. Choose this format in environments where human readability is more important than structured log parsing.

### JSON format

The JSON format structures log data for programmatic processing and integration with log management systems:

```json
{"level":"info","ts":1750160027.442782,"logger":"license","caller":"loader/inject.go:52","msg":"initializing license...","component":"vcluster"}
{"level":"info","ts":1750160027.4497442,"logger":"license","caller":"loader/inject.go:59","msg":"detected license type","component":"vcluster","licenseType":"Online"}
{"level":"info","ts":1750160029.1307533,"caller":"online/license.go:141","msg":"Enabled features:","component":"vcluster"}
{"level":"info","ts":1750160029.1307998,"caller":"online/license.go:146","msg":"connected-clusters","component":"vcluster"}
```

#### JSON log fields

Each JSON log entry contains the following standard fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `level` | string | Log level (`info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`) |
| `ts`    | number | Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch) |
| `caller`| string | Source file and line number |
| `msg`   | string | Log message content |
| `component` | string | vCluster component that generated the log |

Additional fields might be displayed based on context and log content.

The JSON format is ideal for production environments where logs need to be parsed and processed automatically. It works well with log aggregation tools like Elasticsearch or Splunk and supports automated analysis, alerting, and integration with monitoring platforms such as Prometheus and Grafana.

## Examples

### Development environment

For local development with human-readable logs:

```yaml
logging:
  encoding: console
```

### Production environment

For production with structured logging and monitoring:

```yaml
logging:
  encoding: json
```
