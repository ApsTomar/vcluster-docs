description: Configuration for setting structured logging options for vCluster.
---

vCluster prints out structured logs to the console, by default. There are two log-encoding options provided: `console` and `json`.

The default logging option is set to `console`.

## Configure logging

To choose the logging encoding for vCluster logs, you can set the `logging.encoding` field in the `vcluster.yaml` to
one of the following values: `json` or `console`. For example:
```yaml
logging:
  encoding: json
```

:::note
Setting `logging.encoding` value in vCluster.yaml only applies to the logs generated by vCluster and has no control over
platform generated logs. So, make sure that you have set the appropriate logging format in platform as well that suits
your requirements. Refer [platform logging](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/platform/administer/monitoring/metrics#configure-logging)
for configuring logging in platform.

### Console logging

The logs in this format include constant log messages, a human-readable timestamp, log levels, the file and line numberof the source caller, and with variables in the body:

```text
2025-06-16 04:43:25	INFO	license	loader/inject.go:52	initializing license...	{"component": "vcluster"}
2025-06-16 04:43:25	INFO	license	loader/inject.go:59	detected license type	{"component": "vcluster", "licenseType": "Online"}
2025-06-16 04:43:29	INFO	online/license.go:141	Enabled features:	{"component": "vcluster"}
2025-06-16 04:43:29	INFO	online/license.go:146	rancher-integration	{"component": "vcluster"}

```

### JSON logging

In addition to `console` logging, vCluster also supports printing logs encoded in JSON format.

This output format is helpful for structured logging, which allows you to search and filter logs easily.

```text
{"level":"info","ts":1750160027.442782,"logger":"license","caller":"loader/inject.go:52","msg":"initializing license...","component":"vcluster"}
{"level":"info","ts":1750160027.4497442,"logger":"license","caller":"loader/inject.go:59","msg":"detected license type","component":"vcluster","licenseType":"Online"}
{"level":"info","ts":1750160029.1307533,"caller":"online/license.go:141","msg":"Enabled features:","component":"vcluster"}
{"level":"info","ts":1750160029.1307998,"caller":"online/license.go:146","msg":"connected-clusters","component":"vcluster"}
```

The JSON encoded logs contain at least the following fields:

- `level`: The log level of the message
- `ts`: The timestamp of the message (floating-point number of seconds since the Unix epoch)
- `caller`: The file and line number of the message
- `msg`: The message itself
- `component`: The vCluster component that emitted the message
