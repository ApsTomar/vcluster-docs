By default, vCluster generates logs in console format. Console format provides human-readable output that is well-suited for manual log review and troubleshooting. Alternatively, you can configure vCluster to output logs in JSON format. JSON format enables integration with external logging systems for centralized log aggregation and automated monitoring across multiple virtual clusters.

## Log encoding formats

vCluster supports two log encoding formats for the vCluster control plane pod.

- [console](#console-format) (_Default_): Human-readable format. Ideal for development and manual log review.
- [JSON](#json-format): Structured format for log aggregation. Ideal for external monitoring and analysis tools. 

### Console format

The console format provides human-readable logs with timestamps, log levels, source locations, and contextual information. This format works well for use cases where users are troubleshooting a single virtual cluster. Choose this format in environments where human readability is more important than structured log parsing. Example use cases include:

- Local development and testing, where developers benefit from quick, readable output
- Single virtual cluster analysis, where users manually review logs and debug in a terminal

```text
2025-06-16 04:43:25	INFO	license	loader/inject.go:52	initializing license...	{"component": "vcluster"}
2025-06-16 04:43:25	INFO	license	loader/inject.go:59	detected license type	{"component": "vcluster", "licenseType": "Online"}
2025-06-16 04:43:29	INFO	online/license.go:141	Enabled features:	{"component": "vcluster"}
2025-06-16 04:43:29	INFO	online/license.go:146	rancher-integration	{"component": "vcluster"}
```

### JSON format
The JSON format structures log data for programmatic processing and integration with log management systems. This format is best suited for use cases where external tools monitor and analyze logs for multiple virtual clusters. Log aggregation tools (for example, Elasticsearch or Splunk) can ingest these logs to support automated analysis, alerting, and integration with monitoring platforms (for example, Prometheus and Grafana). Example use cases include:

- Production environments where you monitor multiple virtual clusters and require automatic parsing and processing of logs

```json
{"level":"info","ts":1750160027.442782,"logger":"license","caller":"loader/inject.go:52","msg":"initializing license...","component":"vcluster"}
{"level":"info","ts":1750160027.4497442,"logger":"license","caller":"loader/inject.go:59","msg":"detected license type","component":"vcluster","licenseType":"Online"}
{"level":"info","ts":1750160029.1307533,"caller":"online/license.go:141","msg":"Enabled features:","component":"vcluster"}
{"level":"info","ts":1750160029.1307998,"caller":"online/license.go:146","msg":"connected-clusters","component":"vcluster"}
```

#### JSON log fields

Each JSON log entry contains the following standard fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `level` | string | Log level (`info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`) |
| `ts`    | number | Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch) |
| `caller`| string | Source file and line number |
| `msg`   | string | Log message content |
| `component` | string | vCluster component that generated the log |

Additional fields might be displayed based on context and log content.

## Enable log encoding

Configure logging in your `vcluster.yaml` configuration file. 

You can enable the JSON format of log encoding.

```yaml 
logging:
  encoding: json
```

If you want to disable the JSON format, you can either remove the `logging` field or explicitly set the console format.

```yaml
logging:
  encoding: console
```

:::note
When changing between encoding formats, the pod restarts and all previous logs are lost.
